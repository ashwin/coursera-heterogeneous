About
=====
***

This **coursera-heterogeneous** project provides offline resources to work on the assignments of [**Heterogenous Parallel Programming**](https://www.coursera.org/course/hetero) course from [**Coursera**](https://www.coursera.org/).
This is a collaborative effort by the students of the course and you are welcome to [contribute](#contributors) to improve it.

Files available include:

- WB API header file (`wb.h`)
- Generate data to test assignments (`GenDataMP1.cpp`, `GenDataMP2.cpp`, ...)
- Assignment files (`MP0.cu`, `MP1.cu`, ...)
- A CUDA diagnostics program (`cudadiag.cu`)

All of this works **only** if you have access to CUDA hardware.

Usage
=====
***

On Windows with Visual Studio
-----------------------------

- Update NVIDIA driver for your CUDA hardware
- Download and install Visual Studio or Visual C++ Express Edition.
- Download and install [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads)
- Create [CUDA project in Visual Studio](http://google.com/search?q=cuda%20project%20in%20visual%20studio)
- Place this `wb.h` in same directory as your CUDA source file (`mp1.cu` for example)
- Compile and run!

On OS X with Xcode
------------------

Make sure you have XCode & Cmake.
You can get cmake from macports via: `sudo port install cmake` or homebrew via:  `brew install cmake`

### Dependencies

- Download and install Xcode from the Apple App Store.
- Download and install NVIDIA CUDA for MacOS from [here](http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/5_0/rel-update-1/installers/cuda_5.0.36_macos.pkg)
- Install cmake from macports (sudo port install cmake) or homebrew (brew install cmake).
- Clone the coursera-heterogenous repository.
- At this point, you can either use the Xcode GUI or use a traditional Unix makefile.

### Using Xcode GUI

Initial setup:

- cd into the repository root directory and run: `cmake CMakeLists.txt -G Xcode`
-  Open the resulting Project.xcodeproj: `open Project.xcodeproj`
-  Change Loading flags:
 -  Highlight Project
 -  Select mp0 under targets
 -  Under Build Settings, select Linking: Other Linker flags
 -  Make sure that the disclosure arrow for "Other Linker Flags" is pointing to the right (i.e. closed)
 -  Double click to expand the flags
 -  Click the (+) at the bottom of the flags window
 -  Add the following: `-F/Library/Frameworks -framework CUDA`
 -  Repeat for other targets: mp1, m2, mp3, etc.

To run each homework assignment:

- Now you can run & add debug points

### Using Unix makefile

Initial setup:

- cd into the repository root directory and run: `cmake CMakeLists.txt`

To run each homework assignment:

- To compile a homework program, run `make mp<N>`, where <N> is a homework number.
 - For example, to compile MP2, run `make mp2`.
- After compiling, to run the homework program, run `./mp<N> tests/mp<N>_data/<D>/*`, where <N> is a homework number and <D> is a dataset number.
 - For example, to execute MP2 on dataset 0, run `./mp3 tests/mp3_data/0/*`.
